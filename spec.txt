Exercise 
Implement a console-based social networking application (similar to Twitter) satisfying the scenarios below.

Scenarios

Posting: Alice can publish messages to a personal timeline

> Alice -> I love the weather today 
> Bob -> Oh, we lost! 
> Bob -> at least it's sunny

Reading: Bob can view Alice's timeline

> Alice
I love the weather today (5 minutes ago)
> Bob
Oh, we lost! (1 minute ago) 
at least it's sunny (2 minutes ago)

Following: Charlie can subscribe to Alice's and Bob's timelines, and view an aggregated list of all subscriptions

> Charlie -> I'm in New York today! Anyone wants to have a coffee? 
> Charlie follows Alice 
> Charlie wall
Charlie - I'm in New York today! Anyone wants to have a coffee? (2 seconds ago) 
Alice - I love the weather today (5 minutes ago)

> Charlie follows Bob 
> Charlie wall
Charlie - I'm in New York today! Anyone wants to have a coffee? (15 seconds ago) 
Bob - Oh, we lost! (1 minute ago) 
Bob - at least it's sunny (2 minutes ago) 
Alice - I love the weather today (5 minutes ago)

General requirements 
- Application must use the console for input and output; 
- User submits commands to the application: 
		posting: <user name> -> <message> 
		reading: <user name> 
		following: <user name> follows <another user> 
		wall: <user name> wall 
- Don't worry about handling any exceptions or invalid commands. Assume that the user will always type the correct commands. Just focus on the sunny day scenarios.
- Use whatever language and frameworks you want. (provide instructions how to run the application)

IMPORTANT: Implement the requirements focusing on writing the best code you can produce.
